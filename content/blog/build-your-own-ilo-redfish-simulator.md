## Introduction

When I started the development of Redfish [Workshops-on-Demand](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops), I rapidly realized that I would not be able to provision more than one or two physical servers with an embedded Redfish allowing students to perform write operations in addition to non-destructive read operations.

I started to look for Redfish simulators and found the [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) based [OpenBmc](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc) simulator that used for the [Redfish API 101](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops)
